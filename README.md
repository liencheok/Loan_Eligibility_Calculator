# Loan Eligibility Calculator

This project was created as part of a **Business Analytics** course.  
It is a Python console application that helps users calculate loan repayment details and evaluate loan eligibility based on the Debt Service Ratio (DSR).

## 📌 Project Description

The Loan Eligibility Calculator allows the user to:

- Calculate **monthly loan instalments** based on principal, interest rate, and loan term.
- Compute the **total amount payable** over the entire loan period.
- Evaluate the **Debt Service Ratio (DSR)** using the user’s monthly income and commitments.
- Determine whether the loan is **approved or denied** based on DSR.
- Store and view previous loan calculations during the session.

This tool models a simplified version of a financial loan assessment used in basic business analytics.
